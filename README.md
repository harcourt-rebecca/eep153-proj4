This Github repository contains the following Jupyter Notebooks:

-   Tanzanian Demands

-   Nutrition Systems

-   Costs 1

-   Costs 2

The following CSV files are also contained within the repository and are necessary for full functionality:

-   fct-full.csv: Full food conversion table for local Tanzanian foods

-   hh_rda.csv: Minimum dietary requirements for different age groups within a household

-   our-prices.csv: Aggregate price information for Tanzanian goods in 2014 TZS prices

-   tanzanian_nps.ds: Formatted dataset containing information for 2008-2014 Tanzania LSMS results

The following documentation will explain how to use each notebook to get the graphics provided in the team presentation, and offer brief explanations of the functions so that they may be used outside the context of this project.
